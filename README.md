# Sign Language Detector with Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe

This project is a real-time Sign Language Detector built using Python, OpenCV, and Mediapipe. It aims to bridge the communication gap for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing by recognizing and translating sign language gestures into text.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes your computer's webcam to capture video frames and perform real-time sign language detection.
- **Hand Tracking**: Leverages Mediapipe's hand tracking solution to accurately identify and track hand landmarks.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Employs machine learning models to recognize various sign language gestures.
- **OpenCV Integration**: Uses OpenCV for image processing tasks such as frame capture and display.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aryam643/Sign_Langusge_Detection.git
    cd Sign_Langusge_Detection
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
